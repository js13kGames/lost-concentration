# Concentration Lost
A game created for the [JS13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) contest 2017.

**Concentration Lost** tests your ability to multi-task by challenging you to not lose your place while switching from one basic task to another.

Four simple puzzles are displayed on the screen but only one is active (can be interacted with). You have a limited amount of time (dependent on the difficulty level) to solve that puzzle before the next one becomes active. If a puzzle is not completed, it will eventually become active again as the game cycles through the tasks. Points are earned for each completed puzzle but the game ends when you fail to solve one after it has been active a set number of times (also dependent on the level).

None of the puzzles are particularly difficult have but they have been designed to make it increasingly difficult to concentrate on the active one while not losing your place in any of the others.

#### Tips
+ The number of points awarded for completing a puzzle is dependent on how many attempts were required before you solved it. Solving it on the first attempt is worth more points than solving it on the second, etc.

+ Completing a puzzle early on the first attempt adds a percentage of the remaining time to the time available for the next puzzle. This is indicated by a green area in the middle of the task pointer which contracts as the time is expended. Try to quickly complete multiple puzzles back to back to increase the time available for the trickier tasks.

### Can you keep from losing your concentration and your place when moving from one task to another?
